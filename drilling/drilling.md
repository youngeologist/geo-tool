## Explore Drilling Data with Interactive Visualizations

This online app, built with Streamlit, allows you to analyze drilling data with ease. Select up to six parameters to visualize, then interactively zoom in and out on the timeframe to closely examine the data. With Plotly charts, you can easily scan parameter values and capture key insights with the built-in screenshot functionality.

The process is simple:

<li>Prepare a timeseries Excel file (XLS only) with a single row of data headers.
<li>Ensure the "TIME" data occupies the first column.
<li>Upload the file to the app.
