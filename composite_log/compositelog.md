# Composite Log Visualization

This app provides a straightforward way to visualize composite logs, including drilling, mudlog, LWD/elog data, markers, and fluid interpretations. By uploading a pre-formatted Excel file (.xls only) with the required data, you can access and analyze your well data from anywhere, without needing specialized software.

Data Format:

To ensure seamless integration and simplify workflow, please follow this simple data format:

<li><b>Create Sheets</b>: Create the following sheets within your Excel file: HEADER, LOGDATA, GASDATA, SURVEY, MARKER, GASPEAK, and FLUID.
<li><b>Structure Data</b>: Organize your data in tables within each sheet as per template (download sample data).

### Log Settings:

<li><b>Depth Units</b>: The depth unit will be determined by the "UNIT" value specified in the "HEADER" sheet.
<li><b>Depth Mode</b>: You can choose to display depth in MD, TVD, or TVDSS.
<li><b>Scale</b>: Adjust the scale to 1000, 500, or 200. Please note that there might be a slight delay in scale adjustments.
<li><b>Log Display Range</b>: Set the top and bottom depth limits for the log display using slider.

<i>Note: For very long logs, you might need to adjust the top, bottom, or scale settings to avoid display errors</i>.
